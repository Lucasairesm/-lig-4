            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>The first player to align 3 consecutive pieces (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.</p>

            <h2>Board</h2>
            <p>The board is a vertical grid of 3 columns by 3 rows.</p>

            <h2>Pieces</h2>
            <p>Each player has a piece of a distinct color and figure.</p>

            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Players take turns, with each player filling an empty space with their colored piece in any space on the board.</li>
                <li>The game continues until one player aligns 3 consecutive pieces, or until the board is completely filled, resulting in a draw.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>End of Game</h2>
            <p>The game ends when one player successfully aligns 3 pieces, and the winner is declared based on the color chosen by the player. At the end, the player must click the button to end the game and start a new one.</p>
            <p>In the event of a draw, players will have the option to restart the game or exit.</p>
